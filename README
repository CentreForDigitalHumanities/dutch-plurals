# Dutch Plurals

This contains a list of manually annotated/verified Dutch plural singular/lemma combinations. This was done by Henk Pander Maat and can be found under `input.tsv`.

Using `transform.py` this can be converted into `output.tsv` which is a file which can be used as input for [`froggen`](https://frognlp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html).
