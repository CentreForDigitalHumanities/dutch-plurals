# Dutch Plurals

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/694572139.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10491765)

This contains a list of manually annotated/verified Dutch plural singular/lemma combinations. This was done by Henk Pander Maat and can be found under `input.tsv`.

Using `transform.py` this can be converted into `output.tsv` which is a file which can be used as input for [`froggen`](https://frognlp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html).

## Wiktionary

Using the machine-readable Wiktionary data from [Tatu Ylonen](https://kaikki.org/dictionary/Dutch/pos-noun/index.html) the list were expanded and the articles (de/het) were determined.
